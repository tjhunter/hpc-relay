"""
Wrapper for prefect tasks to submit and monitor sbatch jobs on HPCs.

Implementation notes:
This wrapper is rather complex because of the following:
- handling transient errors (network failures, sacct outages, prefect crash, driver script crash)
  without losing the state
- avoid duplicate slurm submitions on retries (best effort)
- limit the number of concurrent polling calls to the HPC (1 per HPC at a time) to avoid
  overwhelming it with sacct calls.
This requires coordination between all running jobs to prevent duplicatte polling.
This itself has to account for issues like crashes during polling.

As a result:
- the submission step is cached as a separate task, so on retry we replay the cached submission
  result instead of re-submitting (which would create a new job on the HPC).
- we use prefect variables as a shared source of truth for the job status, which the monitoring
  loop updates and the polling steps read from. This way, if the polling loop crashes or
  encounters a transient error, we don't lose the state and can resume from the last known
  status on retry.
- we implement a leasing mechanism for the polling loop to ensure only one active poller per HPC
  at a time. The lease is stored in a prefect variable with an expiry time; any poller that
  finds an expired lease can attempt to acquire it by writing a new lease with a fresh expiry.
  This way, if a poller crashes while holding the lease, other pollers can detect the expired
  lease and take over the polling responsibilities without manual intervention.
