"""
Command runner for ECMWF / Atos clusters via the ECaccess SOAP gateway.

Unlike EcmwfSshCommandRunner, this runner does not need an interactive
Teleport / tsh session. It authenticates with a long-lived `.eccert.crt`
certificate and submits each command as an ECaccess job through the
public boaccess gateway.

Trade-off: every `run()` call is an ECaccess job submission + poll, so
even trivial commands take seconds. Use this when you need to drive an
HPC from somewhere without ssh access (CI, a remote scheduler), not as
a drop-in replacement for ssh.
